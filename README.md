P1 - Create a New Python Module (Company Byline)

Specification for Project 1 Python Module

Overview

This project introduces Python for professional data analytics. We cover some syntax and Python basics, but there is much more to using Python professionally. In these first few projects, we introduce syntax along with key tools and skills used in industry. This project focues on basic data types and filel organization while building a reusable Python module. The module provides an introductory byline for a hypothetical data analytics consulting company, while demonstrating skills with data types, f-strings, descriptive statistics, and more.

Objective

Develop a Python module with a byline function displaying information about your data analytics consulting business or analyst profile. The byline should be constructed using various Python data types.
